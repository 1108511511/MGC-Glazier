Currently working on GUI - specifically how to get drop boxes inside table cells
for efficient data input. GUI is based on a card layout with one JFrame and
overlapping JPanels that hide themselves and display another when a major screen
event happens (moving from one 'screen' to another. I'm designing the screens in
netbeans and just editing them in vim, so you guys wont have to worry about me
going overboard doing it from scratch.

Give me a hoy if there's any questions yeah?
